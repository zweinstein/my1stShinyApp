# ReadMe
## Making Biological Buffers with the Help of R 
### This repository contains the source codes (ui.R and server.R) I used to develop a prototype Shiny App to help scientists and students prepare biological buffers with potassium phosphate salts. The App is hosted on my Shinyapps.io account: https://zweinstein.shinyapps.io/App_Buffer_pH/. 
### I also made a 5-page presentation to introduce this Shiny App (index.Rmd in this repository). The presentation is available on my Github Pages account: http://zweinstein.github.io/my1stShinyApp/index.html (use arrow keys to flip slides).
